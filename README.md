# macOS local Time Machine backup deleterï£¿

This is a BASH script to manage and delete local Time Machine backups that get created automatically on macOS High Sierra 10.13 and Mojave 10.14. macOS Catalina 10.15 is currently not supported.

This will not affect your regular Time Machine backups to an external hard drive, nor will it wipe any data on your Mac. It will only delete those locally generated backups or "snapshots" to free up some precious SSD storage space.

## Installation

1. Clone/fork this repo to your Mac
2. Open Terminal.app and `cd` into the repo directory
3. Install by running `bash install.sh`
4. Once installed, you can run the script at any time by typing `backup_deleter`.
5. Profit!
